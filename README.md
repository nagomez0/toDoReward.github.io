# toDoReward.github.io
This is a personal project to help with personal difficulties surrounding productivity and budgeting. I recently bought two 6 sided dice to help provide an interactive element in completing my to do list. I also incorporated an element to reward a random cash value for completing each task. 

This code will ask the user for 12 'to-do' inputs. It will then randomize the tasks and enumirate them. The user will then use their dice to see which task they will complete. After completing a task, the user will input the task number and the code will generate a random '$' value between 1-15 as a reward for completing a task. The code will mark the task as complete and the user continues until the to-do list is complete and returns total earnings for the completed tasks.

In theory, the 'true random' of the to do list will make the surprise and interactive element motivating the user to complete each task. The sum of money earned is the only money the user can use in their day to day life. Want more spending money? Get stuff done. It's a task and reward system built on accountability and discipline.
